Looking at the HTML and CSS code, I can identify several issues that are preventing proper responsiveness:

1. Grid Layout Issues:
   - While you're using `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))`, the container itself has a fixed `max-width: 1200px` which can cause issues on smaller screens
   - The grid gap of 20px is fixed and doesn't adjust for smaller screens

2. Container Issues:
   - The container has a fixed margin of 20px which doesn't adapt well to smaller screens
   - There's no padding consideration for smaller screens

3. Card Issues:
   - Card content (especially text) uses fixed `<br>` tags for layout which breaks responsive design
   - Images have fixed dimensions (50px Ã— 50px) without responsive considerations

Let me create a fixed version with proper responsiveness:

Key improvements made for responsiveness:

1. Fluid Container:
   - Used `width: min(95%, 1200px)` for a responsive container width
   - Added responsive padding using `clamp()`
   - Improved grid layout with smaller minimum column width

2. Responsive Typography:
   - Used `clamp()` for font sizes to make them responsive
   - Removed fixed `<br>` tags and let text flow naturally
   - Added proper margin and padding for text elements

3. Responsive Spacing:
   - Used `clamp()` for padding and gaps
   - Added media queries for adjusting spacing on mobile devices
   - Made image sizes responsive with `clamp()`

4. Better Mobile Layout:
   - Added `clear: both` for paragraph text on mobile to prevent wrapping issues
   - Adjusted padding and margins for smaller screens
   - Made the grid gap smaller on mobile devices

5. Modern CSS Features:
   - Used CSS custom properties for better maintainability
   - Employed modern layout techniques like `min()` and `clamp()`
   - Improved image handling with proper aspect ratio maintenance
