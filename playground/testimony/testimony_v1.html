      <p class="highlight"><br>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
      <br>
        <p class="context">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <p class="highlight"></br>Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</p>
      <br>
        <p class="context">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br>some structure from 
        professionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former 
        student of theirs<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff 
        did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team 
        project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In<br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>developent 
        experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</p>
