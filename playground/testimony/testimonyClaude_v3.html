            <p class="highlight">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
            <p class="context">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="context">Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>

            <p class="context">The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

I'll adjust the grid layout to match that exact arrangement.

Key changes made:
1. Updated the grid-template-areas to the correct layout:
   - Top row: Daniel, Jonathan, Kira
   - Bottom row: Jeanette, Patrick, Kira (continuing)
2. Maintained Kira's card spanning two rows on the right
3. Kept the mobile responsiveness with vertical stacking
4. All other styling remains the same

The layout now exactly matches your specified arrangement with:
- Daniel and Jonathan's testimonials in the top row
- Kira's testimonial on the right spanning both rows
- Jeanette and Patrick's testimonials in the second row
- Mobile view stacks all cards vertically

Key changes made:
1. Changed grid layout to 4 columns to better control card widths:
   - Daniel's card now spans 2 columns (daniel daniel)
   - Patrick's card now spans 2 columns (patrick patrick)
2. Reduced overall card height by:
   - Decreasing padding from 20px to 16px
   - Reducing margins and line height
   - Making font sizes slightly smaller
   - Reducing image size from 50px to 35px
   - Reducing spacing between elements
3. Maintained responsive behavior for mobile devices

The layout should now look more compact vertically while having wider cards for Daniel and Patrick's testimonials. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the sizes?
