Looking at the HTML and CSS code, I can identify several issues that are preventing proper responsiveness:

## Grid Layout Issues:

While you're using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)), the container itself has a fixed max-width: 1200px which can cause issues on smaller screens
The grid gap of 20px is fixed and doesn't adjust for smaller screens

## Container Issues:

The container has a fixed margin of 20px which doesn't adapt well to smaller screens
There's no padding consideration for smaller screens

## Card Issues:

Card content (especially text) uses fixed <br> tags for layout which breaks responsive design
Images have fixed dimensions (50px Ã— 50px) without responsive considerations

# Key improvements made for responsiveness:

## Fluid Container:

Used width: min(95%, 1200px) for a responsive container width
Added responsive padding using clamp()
Improved grid layout with smaller minimum column width


## Responsive Typography:

Used clamp() for font sizes to make them responsive
Removed fixed <br> tags and let text flow naturally
Added proper margin and padding for text elements


## Responsive Spacing:

Used clamp() for padding and gaps
Added media queries for adjusting spacing on mobile devices
Made image sizes responsive with clamp()

## Better Mobile Layout:

Added clear: both for paragraph text on mobile to prevent wrapping issues
Adjusted padding and margins for smaller screens
Made the grid gap smaller on mobile devices

## Modern CSS Features:

Used CSS custom properties for better maintainability
Employed modern layout techniques like min() and clamp()
Improved image handling with proper aspect ratio maintenance

## The main changes I made while including all the content:

Removed all <br> tags from the content to allow natural text flow
Properly structured the testimonial content with consistent spacing
Maintained the same content but made it responsive
Kept all the testimonial cards with their original colors and styling
Made sure the grid layout works with all five cards

## The page will now:

Reflow cards based on screen size
Maintain readability on all devices
Keep consistent spacing between elements
Preserve the visual hierarchy of the content
Scale text and images appropriately

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
